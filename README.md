## Description
Interested in investing in cryptocurrency, but don't know where to begin? Coin-Vault is an application that lets you simulate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency. With real-time data fetched using CoinRanking API, you can compare prices for four separate coins (BitCoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, and DogeCoin) and decide whether to buy or sell using this information. When you register for an account, you're granted $10,000 of coins to use with your discretion.* Using Coin-Vault, you can mimic the thrill of the purchase when you buy low, and the excitement when you sell high! 
  
*Coin-Vault does not purchase or sell actual coins. No payment information is required.
